Waterford
Quaker
Hill
area
was
part
of
early
land
divisions
when
New
London
was
settled
by
English
Colonists
in
the
mid-17th
century
Much
of
the
land
in
the
area
was
acquired
by
James
Rogers
whose
family
eventually
split
from
the
local
Congregationalist
church
to
form
a
sect
called
"Rogerenes"
after
their
leader
that
borrowed
from
both
Baptist
and
Quaker
theology
The
Rogerenes
-mid-17th
-century
-Much
of
the
land
in
refused
to
accept
colonial
authority
or
pay
ministerial
taxes
and
the
village
they
formed
developed
without
the
traditional
central
meeting
house
In
1792
Old
Norwich
Road
was
built
through
the
area
as
a
turnpike
joining
New
London
and
Norwich
Only
a
few
buildings
survive
in
the
village
prior
to
its
construction
including
the
only
stone
house
built
in
1794
for
Christopher
Green
In
the
19th
century
the
village
John
McCarthy
invented
LISP
in
1958
shortly
after
the
development
of
FORTRAN
It
was
first
implemented
by
Steve
Russell
on
an
IBM
74
computer
It
is
particularly
suitable
for
Artificial
Intelligence
programs
as
it
processes
symbolic
information
effectively
Common
Lisp
originated
during
the
198s
and
199s
in
an
attempt
to
unify
the
work
of
several
implementation
groups
that
were
successors
to
Maclisp
like
ZetaLisp
and
NIL
(New
Implementation
of
Lisp)
etc
It
serves
as
a
common
language
which
can
be
easily
extended
for
specific
implementation
Programs
written
in
Common
LISP
do
not
depend
on
machine-specific
characteristics
such
as
word
length
etc
Almost
in
every
country
in
the
world
enthusiastic
fans
fill
the
stands
of
the
stadiums
to
the
point
of
failure
to
see
the
coordinated
actions
and
skill
of
the
players
Football
does
not
know
equal
among
sports
games
This
is
the
most
popular
and
massive
sport
16
countries
participate
in
international
cups
and
championships
Rugby
and
American
football
are
no
less
popular
although
not
so
widespread
The
difference
is
that
in
these
games
sportsmen
played
with
an
oval
ball
and
in
football
-
round
Matches
of
American
football
in
professional
and
university
leagues
gather
thousands
of
crowds
of
spectators
in
the
USA
The
rugby
game
is
common
in
the
UK
France
Australia
and
New
Zealand
Among
other
types
of
football
Gaelic
(played
in
Ireland)
and
football
by
Australian
rules
(especially
popular
in
Melbourne)
There
are
two
teams
of
11
people
who
try
to
kick
the
ball
or
head
the
ball
into
the
opponent's
goal
in
a
football
match
The
gate
is
protected
by
the
goalkeeper
and
only
he
can
touch
the
ball
with
his
hands
The
ancestor
of
modern
football
which
is
called
"old
football"
was
particularly
tough
and
it
almost
didnâ€™t
have
any
rules
Already
in
the
XIV
century
it
was
banned
Today
the
planet
suffers
